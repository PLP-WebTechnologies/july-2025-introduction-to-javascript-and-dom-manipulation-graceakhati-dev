🌸 WanderJoy – Web Development Assignment
📖 Project Overview

This project, WanderJoy, was created as part of my software development training assignment.
The goal is to demonstrate basic web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It includes:

A greeting alert when the page loads.

An interactive welcome text that changes when clicked.

A light/dark theme toggle button.

A simple contact form (structure only).



🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 → Page structure

CSS3 → Styling and theme design

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) → Interactivity

⚡ How to Test the Project

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Observe the welcome alert popup.

Click on the text “Welcome to WanderJoy 🌸” → it should change to “✨ You’re now exploring WanderJoy! ✨”.

Use the “Toggle Theme” button → switches between light and dark mode.

Scroll to the bottom to view the demo contact form.
